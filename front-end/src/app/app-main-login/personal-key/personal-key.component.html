            To protect your account, you need a password and access to your phone, or an authentication application at
            sign-in. If you can't use your phone, you can sign in with your Personal Key instead. For your privacy and
            security, fec.gov does not store your password and Personal Key. Only you will know them. You will only have
            access and the ability to share your personal information. We urge you to store your Personal Key outside of
            your computer or mobile device so that it will be safe even if your devices are stolen or your online
            accounts are hacked. If you do not have your Personal Key and you forget your password, the way to keep your
            account safe is to verify that you are the legal owner by contacting the Electronic Filing Office at (202)
