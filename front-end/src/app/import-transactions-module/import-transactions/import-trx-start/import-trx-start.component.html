  <ol>
    <li class="import_trx__first-item">
      At the top right of the screen, select Tools and then Import Transactions. The Import Tranactions Landing Page
      (this page) will appear.
    </li>
    <li>Click "Begin Upload" to navigate to the Upload Page.</li>
    <li>
      Locate your import file using your computer's file explorer, and then drag and drop that file into the grey-shaded
      area provided, or use the "Upload" button option to open the file explorer and locate the file you would like to
      import. The import file should have a .CSV extension, or it wil not be accepted.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the upload begins the file will be scanned for formatting errors. If there are any formatting errors the
      upload will be cancelled and an error message will be displayed listing all of the formatting errors found. If no
      errors are found you wil proceed to the "Review"page.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once at the "Review" page the file will be scanned for matching transactions within the file that may have been
      previously uploaded. Bascially scanning the import file to see if the file has previously been imported. If there
      are matching transactions from a previously uploaded file the system will provide a warning, and a prompt to
      proceed or not to prevent from possibly uploading the same file twice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next the the system will scan for duplicate contact entries within the file against your contacts database. If
      there are possible duplicate contact entries, you will be taken to the "Clean" screen to select which contact
      entries you would like to keep or merge. You will also have the option to ignore the process allowing for
      duplicate entries from the uploaded file and your current contact database to exist. If no duplicates exist, the
      screen will display the text: "No Duplicates found."
    </li>
    <li>
      Next the Import will begin after the previous step. A loader with a completion percentage will be displayed
      allowing the user to view the progress of the import. Once the import is complete the user can navigate to the
      Notifications Modal (Top Menu/Notifications) to view the import and others via the link provided.

<h3 class="import_trx__heading">How to enter data into the CSV templates</h3>
<div>
  When entering data into a CSV template, ensure the fields within the template match with what you are planning to
  import. CSV files will not always save information within the CSV format, so you may need to save the file as an excel
  document first, and then when complete save in a CSV format. Further Import Instructions and Information is provided
  below.
</div>
<h3 class="import_trx__heading-list">Additional Import Information and Instructions</h3>
<div class="import_trx__import-directions">
  <ol class="import_trx__alpha-list">
    <li class="import_trx__first-item">A Filer can only import transactions to the specific reports: F3X or F3L.</li>
    <li>Reports must be in a "Saved," or "Amended" status before starting the import process.</li>
    <li>
      Always clean the Contacts Database for possible duplicates before initiating an Import:
      <ul class="import_trx__import-directions">
        <li>
          Filer can select one file or multiple files to drag & drop. The limit is 10 files. The Filer can only
          upload/import a .CSV file for one schedule. Transactions from different schedules cannot be combined into 1
          CSV file.
        </li>
        <li>Each CSV file must correspond to a schedule type and include transactions ONLY for that schedule.</li>
        <li>
          The Filer can also split a schedule into separate files, but we recommend having all the corresponding
          transactions for each schedule in one file/schedule because of the limitation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Once all of the transactions are imported, the language required by FEC in certain fields of the transactions will
      be auto calculated.
      <ul class="import_trx__import-directions">
        <li>
          Language: Some transactions will have language that is auto-generated. Please refer to the Form 3X format
          specifications to determine if you should leave the description field blank or if you need to include data.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Aggregate amounts for each transaction will be auto calculated along with the existing transactions and displayed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any transactions that will be auto generated based on imported transactions, will be auto generated and saved to
      the database. In-Kind Receipt (imported) → In-Kind Out must be auto generated.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Filer has to manually add the "Levin Account name" under "Profile" menu. When the filer is adding LAs or LBs
      into the template, they will need to add the "Levin Account name" (from the application) into that column.
    </li>
  </ol>

<h3 class="import_trx__heading">Receipt Description & Purpose of Disbursement fields</h3>

  Filers must review the "Value Reference" in the import specs for the exact language that should be included for
  "Receipt Description," and "Purpose of Disbursement Fields."
</div>
<h3 class="import_trx__heading">Employer & Occupation</h3>
<div>
  Employer and occupation fields are required if an individual donor aggregate is greater than $200. Please note that
