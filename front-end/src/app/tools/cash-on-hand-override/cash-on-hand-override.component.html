      <p>
        When there is a discrepancy between the reported cash on hand and the correct cash on hand (bank account
        balance), committees filing a Form 3X can override the reported cash on hand by manually entering an amount for
        Line 6(a). If your committee overrides Line 6(a), the cash on hand will be adjusted for any reports in that
        calendar year (submitted or in-progress) and amendments may need to be submitted. Further, if the cash on hand
        is overridden on a report from a prior year, reports in subsequent years will also be adjusted and amendments
        may be needed.
      </p>
      <strong class="section-header">NEED HELP?</strong>
      <p>
        If you’re unsure whether an override is the right choice for your committee, please reach out to your assigned
        campaign finance analyst for guidance.
