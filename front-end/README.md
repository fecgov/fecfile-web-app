## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Before you can run the end-to-end tests, you must first set the following environment variables: (the values will depend on your local database)
```
export CYPRESS_EMAIL=''
export CYPRESS_COMMITTEE_ID=''
export CYPRESS_PASSWORD=''
export CYPRESS_PIN=''
```

Once ready, run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

If you need a mock API to begin front end development, you can use the Node server setup within the server directory.
To start the server you run the command `npm run json-server`.
